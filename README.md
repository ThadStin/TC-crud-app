### About Thristee Brews

Thirstee Brews is a full CRUD website built with Skeleton CSS, Node.js, Mongoose, Express, EJS, and 
deployed with Heroku.  The initial seed data was taken from https://www.openbrewerydb.org/.

Thirstee Brews was created to log location and url's of breweries for easy access to information.
A User can upload new breweries anywhere in the world or edit existing breweries already in the 
database.

### Improvements
Eventually, I would like to add: 
  1. ratings  
  2. sort funtionality to the site.  
    -alphabetical  
    -state  
    -country  
    -rating  
  3. mapping feature  
  4. default image if a User logs a new brewery without upoading an image  
  5. a modal to display multiple images of a single brewery.  

Overall, I am happy with the design, but it could use a couple of tweaks.  The forms on the edit
and new pages are not satisfactory to me.  I also feel the text on mobile is a little too small
and the pics are a little too big.  I have not had a chance to fix that yet, though.
